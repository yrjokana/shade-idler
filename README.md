# SHΔDE - Game Idler Tool

**SHΔDE** is a lightweight keyboard and mouse automation tool for games. It lets you simulate holding movement keys, jumping, or clicking — all easily controlled with hotkeys.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Use at your own risk. This tool sends input to games and may be considered automation or AFK scripting in certain cases.
