# SHΔDE - Game Idler Tool

SHΔDE is a keyboard/mouse automation tool for games. It lets you simulate holding movement keys, jumping, or clicking — all toggleable with hotkeys.

⚠️ Use at your own risk. This tool sends input to games and could be considered automation or AFK scripting.

## 🎮 Features

- W + D Hold Mode (`F6`)
- Jump Mode (`F8`)
- Combo Mode (`F9`)
- Auto-Clicker Mode (`F7`)
- Custom delay for auto-clicker
- Mode isolation (no accidental toggles)
- Hotkey-based control
- Clean Exit (`F10`)

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Download the `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shade-idler/releases)
2. Launch it (no installation needed)
3. Read the disclaimer and accept to start
4. Use the menu to choose between Idler or Auto-Clicker modes
5. Press hotkeys to toggle features
6. Press `ESC` to go back or `F10` to quit

## 💡 Future Plans

- Save/load settings
- GUI (Windows Forms or WPF)
- More modes
